  abstract = {This paper presents the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for the classification of chronic lower back pain (CLBP) using the EmoPain dataset. Our work has two main contributions. We introduce Spike Threshold Adaptive Learning (STAL), a trainable encoder that effectively converts continuous biosignals into spike trains. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of Spiking Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) classifiers for the multi-stream processing of sEMG and IMU data. To tackle the challenges of small sample size and class imbalance, we implement minority over-sampling with weighted sample replacement during batch creation. Our method achieves outstanding performance with an accuracy of 80.43\textbackslash\%, AUC of 67.90\textbackslash\%, F1 score of 52.60\textbackslash\%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.437, surpassing traditional rate-based and latency-based encoding methods. The STAL encoder shows superior performance in preserving temporal dynamics and adapting to signal characteristics. Importantly, our approach (STAL-SRNN) outperforms the best deep learning method in terms of MCC, indicating better balanced class prediction. This research contributes to the development of neuromorphic computing for biosignal analysis. It holds promise for energy-efficient, wearable solutions in chronic pain management.},

  abstract = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have piqued researchers' interest because of their capacity to process temporal information and low power consumption. However, current state-of-the-art methods limited their biological plausibility and performance because their neurons are generally built on the simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Due to the high level of dynamic complexity, modern neuron models have seldom been implemented in SNN practice. In this study, we adopt the Phase Plane Analysis (PPA) technique, a technique often utilized in neurodynamics field, to integrate a recent neuron model, namely, the Izhikevich neuron. Based on the findings in the advancement of neuroscience, the Izhikevich neuron model can be biologically plausible while maintaining comparable computational cost with LIF neurons. By utilizing the adopted PPA, we have accomplished putting neurons built with the modified Izhikevich model into SNN practice, dubbed as the Standardized Izhikevich Tonic (SIT) neuron. For performance, we evaluate the suggested technique for image classification tasks in self-built LIF-and-SIT-consisted SNNs, named Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) on static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets and neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture datasets. The experimental results indicate that the suggested method achieves comparable accuracy while exhibiting more biologically realistic behaviors on nearly all test datasets, demonstrating the efficiency of this novel strategy in bridging the gap between neurodynamics and SNN practice.},

Environmental sound, including urban soundscapes, poses challenges due to variable frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events, while most spike based audio encoding research has focused on speech. This paper analyzes three spike encoding methods, Threshold Adaptive Encoding (TAE), Step Forward (SF), and Moving Window (MW) across three datasets: ESC10, UrbanSound8K, and TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes. Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets. Moreover, TAE yields the lowest spike firing rates, indicating superior energy efficiency. For downstream environmental sound classification with a standard SNN, TAE also achieves the best performance among the compared encoders. Overall, this work provides foundational insights and a comparative benchmark to guide the selection of spike encoders for neuromorphic environmental sound processing.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75\textbackslash\% on CIFAR-10 dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time processing possible.},

  abstract = {As the representatives of brain-inspired models at the neuronal level, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown great promise in processing spatiotemporal information with intrinsic temporal dynamics. SNNs are expected to further improve their robustness and computing efficiency by introducing top-down attention at the architectural level, which is crucial for the human brain to support advanced intelligence. However, this attempt encounters difficulties in optimizing the attention in SNNs largely due to the lack of annotations. Here, we develop a hybrid network model with a top-down attention mechanism (HTDA) by incorporating an artificial neural network (ANN) to generate attention maps based on the features extracted by a feedforward SNN. The attention map is then used to modulate the encoding layer of the SNN so that it focuses on the most informative sensory input. To facilitate direct learning of attention maps and avoid labor-intensive annotations, we propose a general principle and a corresponding weakly-supervised objective, which promotes the HTDA model to utilize an integral and small subset of the input to give accurate predictions. On this basis, the ANN and the SNN can be jointly optimized by surrogate gradient descent in an end-to-end manner. We comprehensively evaluated the HTDA model on object recognition tasks, which demonstrates strong robustness to adversarial noise, high computing efficiency, and good interpretability. On the widely-adopted CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST benchmarks, the HTDA model reduces firing rates by up to 50\% and improves adversarial robustness by up to 10\% with comparable or better accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art SNNs. The HTDA model is also verified on dynamic neuromorphic datasets and achieves consistent improvements. This study provides a new way to boost the performance of SNNs by employing a hybrid top-down attention mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) have demonstrated remarkable performance in SE, they require significant computational power, along with high energy costs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to SE using a spiking neural network (SNN) based on a U-Net architecture. SNNs are suitable for processing data with a temporal dimension, such as speech, and are known for their energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As such, SNNs are thus interesting candidates for real-time applications on devices with limited resources. The primary objective of the current work is to develop an SNN-based model with comparable performance to a state-of-the-art ANN model for SE. We train a deep SNN using surrogate-gradient-based optimization and evaluate its performance using perceptual objective tests under different signal-to-noise ratios and real-world noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed energy-efficient SNN model outperforms the Intel Neuromorphic Deep Noise Suppression Challenge (Intel N-DNS Challenge) baseline solution and achieves acceptable performance compared to an equivalent ANN model.},

While models of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can now be trained using gradient descent to reach an accuracy comparable to equivalent conventional neural networks, such learning often relies on external labels. However, real-world data is unlabeled which can make supervised methods inapplicable. To solve this problem, we propose a Hybrid Guided Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which encodes event-based data sensed by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) into a latent space representation using an SNN. These representations can be used as an embedding to measure data similarity and predict labels in real-world data. We show that the Hybrid Guided-VAE achieves 87\textbackslash\% classification accuracy on the DVSGesture dataset and it can encode the sparse, noisy inputs into an interpretable latent space representation, visualized through T-SNE plots. We also implement the encoder component of the model on neuromorphic hardware and discuss the potential for our algorithm to enable real-time learning from real-world event data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, spiking neural networks were introduced in science as the third generation of artificial neural networks leading to a tremendous energy saving on neuromorphic processors. This sustainable effect is due to the sparse nature of signal processing in-between spiking neurons leading to much less scalar multiplications as in second-generation networks. The spiking neuron's efficiency is even more pronounced by their inherently recurrent nature being useful for recursive function approximations. We believe that there is a need for a general regression framework for SNNs to explore the high potential of neuromorphic computations. However, besides many classification studies with SNNs in the literature, nonlinear neuromorphic regression analysis represents a gap in research. Hence, we propose a general SNN approach for function approximation applicable for complex transient signal processing taking surrogate gradients due to the discontinuous spike representation into account. However, to pay attention to the need for high memory access during deep SNN network communications, additional spiking Legrendre Memory Units are introduced in the neuromorphic architecture. Path-dependencies and evolutions of signals can be tackled in this way. Furthermore, interfaces between real physical and binary spiking values are necessary. Following this intention, a hybrid approach is introduced, exhibiting an autoencoding strategy between dense and spiking layers. However, to verify the presented framework of nonlinear regression for a wide spectrum of scientific purposes, we see the need for obtaining realistic complex transient short-time signals by an extensive experimental set-up. Hence, a measurement technique for benchmark experiments is proposed with high-frequency oscillations measured by capacitive and piezoelectric sensors resulting in wave propagations and inelastic solid deformations to be predicted by the developed SNN regression analysis. Hence, the proposed nonlinear regression framework can be deployed to a wide range of scientific and technical applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the effectiveness of a spiking neural network (SNN) for Electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition has been validated, but there is a lack of comprehensive consideration of the problems of heavy training burden, poor robustness, and high energy consumption in the application of actual myoelectric control systems. In order to explore the feasibility of the application of SNN in actual myoelectric control systems, this paper investigated an EMG pattern recognition scheme based on SNN. To alleviate the differences in EMG distribution caused by electrode shifts and individual differences, the adaptive threshold encoding was applied to gesture sample encoding. To improve the feature extraction ability of SNN, the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron that combines voltage–current effect was adopted as a spike neuron model. To balance recognition accuracy and power consumption, experiments were designed to determine encoding parameter and LIF neuron release threshold. By conducting the gesture recognition experiments considering different training test ratios, electrode shifts, and user independences on the nine-gesture high-density and low-density EMG datasets respectively, the advantages of the proposed SNN-based scheme have been verified. Compared with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), SNN can effectively reduce the number of repetitions in the training set, and its power consumption was reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude. For the high-density and low-density EMG datasets, SNN improved the overall average accuracies by about (0.99 \textasciitilde{} 14.91\%) under different training test ratios. For the high-density EMG dataset, the accuracy of SNN was improved by (0.94 \textasciitilde{} 13.76\%) under electrode-shift condition and (3.81 \textasciitilde{} 18.95\%) in user-independent case. The advantages of SNN in alleviating the user training burden, reducing power consumption, and improving robustness are of great significance for the implementation of user-friendly low-power myoelectric control systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs), using action potentials (spikes) to represent and transmit information, are more biologically plausible than traditional artificial neural networks. However, most of the existing SNNs require a separate preprocessing step to convert the real-valued input into spikes that are then input to the network for processing. The dissected spike-coding process may result in information loss, leading to degenerated performance. However, the biological neuron system does not perform a separate preprocessing step. Moreover, the nervous system may not have a single pathway with which to respond and process external stimuli but allows multiple circuits to perceive the same stimulus. Inspired by these advantageous aspects of the biological neural system, we propose a self-adaptive encoding spike neural network with parallel architecture. The proposed network integrates the input-encoding process into the spiking neural network architecture via convolutional operations such that the network can accept the real-valued input and automatically transform it into spikes for further processing. Meanwhile, the proposed network contains two identical parallel branches, inspired by the biological nervous system that processes information in both serial and parallel.

Existing state-of-the-art methods train a spiking neural network (SNN) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve energy-efficient and fast inference speed in complex/unknown scenes. These methods typically assume that the environment is static while the obstacles in real-world scenes are often dynamic. The movement of obstacles increases the complexity of the environment and poses a great challenge to the existing methods. In this work, we approach robust dynamic obstacle avoidance twofold. First, we introduce the neuromorphic vision sensor (i.e., event camera) to provide motion cues complementary to the traditional Laser depth data for handling dynamic obstacles. Second, we develop an DRL-based event-enhanced multimodal spiking actor network (EEM-SAN) that extracts information from motion events data via unsupervised representation learning and fuses Laser and event camera data with learnable thresholding. Experiments demonstrate that our EEM-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance methods by a significant margin, especially for dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

However, DNNs generally require substantial computational resources, leading to significant economic costs and posing challenges for their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we take advantage of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantization technologies to develop an energy-efficient and lightweight neuromorphic signal processing system. Our system is characterized by two principal innovations: a threshold-adaptive encoding (TAE) method and a quantized ternary SNN (QT-SNN). The TAE method can efficiently encode time-varying analog signals into sparse ternary spike trains, thereby reducing energy and memory demands for signal processing. QT-SNN, compatible with ternary spike trains from the TAE method, quantifies both membrane potentials and synaptic weights to reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two typical signal-processing tasks: speech and electroencephalogram recognition. The results demonstrate that our neuromorphic signal processing system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 94\textbackslash\% reduced memory requirement.

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue for energy-efficient computations on neuromorphic hardware, leveraging the unique advantages of spike-based signaling. Despite their potential, SNNs often lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in performance, mainly due to the complexity of effectively translating ANN activation values into the time domain spikes. This challenge arises due to the quantization and unevenness errors that occur when mapping continuous activations to discrete spikes and irregular spike timing. This paper introduces NeuBridge, an innovative ANN-SNN conversion method that utilize adaptive temporal coding to significantly reduce the number of required time steps without compromising accuracy. NeuBridge addresses the errors by employing a decode–encode neuron and adaptive temporal coding, effectively bridging the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs. By establishing an equivalence between quantized ANNs and SNNs and optimizing the temporal coding process, we improve SNN performance with as few as 2 time steps. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that NeuBridge consistently performs better than existing conversion methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving high performance within just 3 time steps.

  abstract = {Convolution helps spiking neural networks (SNNs) capture the spatio-temporal structures of neuromorphic (event) data as evident in the convolution-based SNNs (C-SNNs) with the state-of-the-art classification-accuracies on various datasets. However, the efficacy aside, the efficiency of C-SNN is questionable. In this regard, we propose SNNs with novel trainable dynamic time-surfaces (DTS-SNNs) as efficient alternatives to convolution. The novel dynamic time-surface proposed in this work features its high responsiveness to moving objects given the use of the zero-sum temporal kernel that is motivated by the simple cells’ receptive fields in the early stage visual pathway. We evaluated the performance and computational complexity of our DTS-SNNs on three real-world event-based datasets (DVS128 Gesture, Spiking Heidelberg dataset, N-Cars). The results highlight high classification accuracies and significant improvements in computational efficiency, e.g., merely 1.51\% behind of the state-of-the-art result on DVS128 Gesture but a  \$\textbackslash times 18\$  improvement in efficiency. The code is available online (https://github.com/dooseokjeong/DTS-SNN).},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power, event-driven computation and intrinsic temporal dynamics, are emerging as promising solutions for processing dynamic, asynchronous signals from event-based sensors. Despite their potential, SNNs face challenges in training and architectural design, resulting in limited performance in challenging event-based dense prediction tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we develop an efficient spiking encoder-decoder network (SpikingEDN) for large-scale event-based semantic segmentation tasks. To enhance the learning efficiency from dynamic event streams, we harness the adaptive threshold which improves network accuracy, sparsity and robustness in streaming inference. Moreover, we develop a dual-path Spiking Spatially-Adaptive Modulation module, which is specifically tailored to enhance the representation of sparse events and multi-modal inputs, thereby considerably improving network performance. Our SpikingEDN attains a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 72.57\{\textbackslash textbackslash\}\textbackslash\% on the DDD17 dataset and 58.32\{\textbackslash textbackslash\}\textbackslash\% on the larger DSEC-Semantic dataset, showing competitive results to the state-of-the-art ANNs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our results shed light on the untapped potential of SNNs in event-based vision applications. The source code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer powerful computation capability due to its event-driven nature and temporal processing. However, it is still limited to shallow structure and simple tasks due to the training difficulty. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional residual spiking neural network (DCRSNN) for text classification tasks. In the DCRSNN, the feature extraction is achieved via a convolution SNN with residual connection, using the surrogate gradient direct training technique. Classification is performed by a fully-connected network. We also suggest a hybrid photonic DCRSNN, in which photonic SNNs are used for classification with a converted training method. The accuracy of hard and soft reset methods, as well as three different surrogate functions, were evaluated and compared across four different datasets. Results indicated a maximum accuracy of 76.36\% for MR, 91.03\% for AG News, 88.06\% for IMDB and 93.99\% for Yelp review polarity. Soft reset methods used in the deep convolutional SNN yielded slightly better accuracy than their hard reset counterparts. We also considered the effects of different pooling methods and observation time windows and found that the convergence accuracy achieved by convolutional SNNs was comparable to that of convolutional neural networks under the same conditions. Moreover, the hybrid photonic DCRSNN also shows comparable testing accuracy. This work provides new insights into extending the SNN applications in the field of text classification and natural language processing, which is interesting for the resources-restrained scenarios.},

  abstract = {The spiking neural network (SNN) exhibits distinct advantages in terms of low power consumption due to its event-driven nature. However, it is limited to simple computer vision tasks because the direct training of SNNs is challenging. In this study, we propose a hybrid architecture called the spiking fully convolutional neural network (SFCNN) to expand the application of SNNs in the field of semantic segmentation. To train the SNN, we employ the surrogate gradient method along with backpropagation. The accuracy of mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the VOC2012 dataset is higher than that of existing spiking FCNs by almost 30\%. The accuracy of mIoU can reach 39.6\%. Moreover, the proposed hybrid SFCNN achieved excellent segmentation performance for other datasets such as COCO2017, DRIVE, and Cityscapes. Our hybrid SFCNN is a valuable and interesting contribution to extending the functionality of SNNs, especially for power-constrained applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
