rayyan-388589274,P01,2024,Accurate and {Efficient} {Event}-based {Semantic} {Segmentation} {Using} {Adaptive} {Spiking} {Encoder}-{Decoder} {Network},"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have piqued researchers' interest because of their capacity to process temporal information and low power consumption. However, current state-of-the-art methods limited their biological plausibility and performance because their neurons are generally built on the simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Due to the high level of dynamic complexity, modern neuron models have seldom been implemented in SNN practice. In this study, we adopt the Phase Plane Analysis (PPA) technique, a technique often utilized in neurodynamics field, to integrate a recent neuron model, namely, the Izhikevich neuron. Based on the findings in the advancement of neuroscience, the Izhikevich neuron model can be biologically plausible while maintaining comparable computational cost with LIF neurons. By utilizing the adopted PPA, we have accomplished putting neurons built with the modified Izhikevich model into SNN practice, dubbed as the Standardized Izhikevich Tonic (SIT) neuron. For performance, we evaluate the suggested technique for image classification tasks in self-built LIF-and-SIT-consisted SNNs, named Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) on static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets and neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture datasets. The experimental results indicate that the suggested method achieves comparable accuracy while exhibiting more biologically realistic behaviors on nearly all test datasets, demonstrating the efficiency of this novel strategy in bridging the gap between neurodynamics and SNN practice.","Zhang, Rui; Leng, Luziwei; Che, Kaiwei; Zhang, Hu; Cheng, Jie; Guo, Qinghai; Liao, Jiangxing; Cheng, Ran",Optics Express,10.48550/arXiv.2304.11857,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11857,learnable and adaptive encoding,"Synaptic weights

rayyan-388589102,P02,2024,Brain-Inspired Architecture for Spiking Neural Networks,"Spiking neural networks inherently rely on the precise timing of discrete spike events for information processing. Incorporating additional bio-inspired degrees of freedom, such as trainable synaptic transmission delays and adaptive firing thresholds, is essential for fully leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs. Although recent methods have demonstrated the benefits of training synaptic weights and delays, both in terms of accuracy and temporal representation, these techniques typically rely on discrete-time simulations, surrogate gradient approximations, or full access to internal state variables such as membrane potentials. Such requirements limit training precision and efficiency and pose challenges for neuromorphic hardware implementation due to increased memory and I/O bandwidth demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical event-driven learning framework that computes exact loss gradients not only with respect to synaptic weights and transmission delays but also to adaptive neuronal firing thresholds. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant gains in accuracy (up to 7\%), timing precision, and robustness compared to existing methods.","Tang, Fengzhen; Zhang, Junhuai; Zhang, Chi; Liu, L.",IEEE Access,10.3390/biomimetics9100646,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207676241&doi=10.3390%2Fbiomimetics9100646&partnerID=40&md5=95d33efc0ee7f21bb0c689694d93de73,learnable and adaptive encoding,"Synaptic weights

The energy-budget mismatch between biological systems and machine vision technology has inspired the development of artificial visual neurons for use in spiking neural network (SNN). However, the lack of multiplexed data coding schemes reduces the ability of artificial visual neurons in SNN to emulate the visual perception ability of biological systems. Here, we present an artificial visual spiking neuron that enables rate and temporal fusion (RTF) coding of external visual information. The artificial neuron can code visual information at different spiking frequencies (rate coding) and enables precise and energy-efficient time-to-first-spike (TTFS) coding. This multiplexed sensory coding scheme could improve the computing capability and efficacy of artificial visual neurons. A hardware-based SNN with the RTF coding scheme exhibits good consistency with real-world ground truth data and achieves highly accurate steering and speed predictions for self-driving vehicles in complex conditions. The multiplexed RTF coding scheme demonstrates the feasibility of developing highly efficient spike-based neuromorphic hardware.","Tandale, Saurabh Balkrishna; Stoffel, Marcus",Neurocomputing,10.1007/s00366-024-01967-3,,learnable and adaptive encoding,"Synaptic weights

Spiking neural networks, known as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are proposed for physics-based artificial intelligence. Accompanied by a new pseudo-explicit integration scheme based on spiking recurrent neural networks leading to a spike-based pseudo explicit integration scheme, the underlying differential equations are solved with a physics-informed strategy. We propose additionally a third-generation spike-based Legendre Memory Unit that handles large sequences. These third-generation networks can be implemented on the coming-of-age neuromorphic hardware resulting in less energy and memory consumption. The proposed framework, although implicit, is viewed as a pseudo-explicit scheme since it requires almost no or fewer online training steps to achieve a converged solution even for unseen loading sequences. The proposed framework is deployed in a Finite Element solver for plate structures undergoing cyclic loading and a Xylo-Av2 SynSense neuromorphic chip is used to assess its energy performance. An acceleration of more than 40\% when compared to classical Finite Element Method simulations and the capability of online training is observed.

In this work, we explore the impact on network inter-layer sparsity through neural coding schemes and the intrinsic structural parameters of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, which can be a candidate metric for performance evaluation. Towards this, we perform a comparative study of four critical neural coding schemes: rate coding (poisson coding), latency coding, phase coding, and direct coding, as well as 6 LIF neuron intrinsic parameter options for a total of 24 combined parameter schemes. Specifically, the models were trained using a supervised training algorithm with a surrogate gradient, and two adversarial attacks, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) were applied on a CIFAR10 dataset. We identified the sources of interlayer sparsity in SNN, and quantitatively analyzed the differences in sparsity caused by coding schemes, neuron leakage factors and thresholds. Various aspects of network performance were thoroughly considered in this paper, including inference accuracy, adversarial robustness, and energy efficiency. Our results show that latency coding is the optimum choice in achieving the highest adversarial robustness and energy efficient against low intensity attacks, while rate coding offers the best adversarial robustness against medium and high intensity attacks. The maximum deviations of robustness and efficiency between different coding schemes are 9.35% in VGG5 and 13.59% in VGG9. Increasing the sparsity of spike activity by improving the threshold can bring a short-lived adversarial robustness sweet spot, while excessive sparsity due to changes in threshold and leakage can instead reduce the adversarial robustness. The study reveals the advantages and disadvantages, and design space of SNN in various dimensions, allowing researchers to frame their neuromorphic systems in terms of the coding methods, neuron inherent structure, and model learning capabilities.","Liu, Chang; Shen, Jiangrong; Ran, Xuming; Xu, Mingkun; Xu, Qi; Xu, Yi; Pan, Gang",,10.48550/arXiv.2506.01968,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01968,learnable encoding,"Learnable clipping threshold

We evaluated the performance and computational complexity of our DTS-SNNs on three real-world event-based datasets (DVS128 Gesture, Spiking Heidelberg dataset, N-Cars).

SNNs are expected to further improve their robustness and computing efficiency by introducing top-down attention at the architectural level, which is crucial for the human brain to support advanced intelligence. However, this attempt encounters difficulties in optimizing the attention in SNNs largely due to the lack of annotations. Here, we develop a hybrid network model with a top-down attention mechanism (HTDA) by incorporating an artificial neural network (ANN) to generate attention maps based on the features extracted by a feedforward SNN. The attention map is then used to modulate the encoding layer of the SNN so that it focuses on the most informative sensory input. To facilitate direct learning of attention maps and avoid labor-intensive annotations, we propose a general principle and a corresponding weakly-supervised objective, which promotes the HTDA model to utilize an integral and small subset of the input to give accurate predictions. On this basis, the ANN and the SNN can be jointly optimized by surrogate gradient descent in an end-to-end manner. We comprehensively evaluated the HTDA model on object recognition tasks, which demonstrates strong robustness to adversarial noise, high computing efficiency, and good interpretability. On the widely-adopted CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST benchmarks, the HTDA model reduces firing rates by up to 50% and improves adversarial robustness by up to 10% with comparable or better accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art SNNs. The HTDA model is also verified on dynamic neuromorphic datasets and achieves consistent improvements. This study provides a new way to boost the performance of SNNs by employing a hybrid top-down attention mechanism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Sun, Antong; Chen, Xiang; Xu, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xu; Chen, Xun",Nature Communications,10.3389/fnins.2023.1174760,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163610018&doi=10.3389%2Ffnins.2023.1174760&partnerID=40&md5=53c52d2393d8869401e9bfcc8cc1524c,Adaptive encoding,Adaptive (data-driven) parameters,Surrogate gradient,Pure SNN architecture,"Sparse spike activity

However, instantiating SNNs that solve complex computational tasks in-silico remains a significant challenge. Surrogate gradient (SG) techniques have emerged as a standard solution for training SNNs end-to-end. Still, their success depends on synaptic weight initialization, similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Yet, unlike in the case of ANNs, it remains elusive what constitutes a good initial state for an SNN. Here, we develop a general initialization strategy for SNNs inspired by the fluctuation-driven regime commonly observed in the brain. Specifically, we derive practical solutions for data-dependent weight initialization that ensure fluctuation-driven firing in the widely used leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We empirically show that SNNs initialized following our strategy exhibit superior learning performance when trained with SGs. These findings generalize across several datasets and SNN architectures, including fully connected, deep convolutional, recurrent, and more biologically plausible SNNs obeying Dale’s law. Thus fluctuation-driven initialization provides a practical, versatile, and easy-to-implement strategy for improving SNN training performance on diverse tasks in neuromorphic engineering and computational neuroscience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Zhang, Yahui; Xiang, Shuiying; Jiang, Shuqing; Han, Yanan; Guo, Xingxing; Zheng, Ling; Shi, Yuechun; Hao, Yue",Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering,10.1364/OE.497218,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171286173&doi=10.1364%2FOE.497218&partnerID=40&md5=d082bfb9c3b9bf1049e1e70bccf94a14,learnable encoding,Synaptic weights,Surrogate gradient,"Hybrid ANN–SNN architecture

In this paper we analyze in theory and simulation the learning dynamics of time-to-first-spike-networks and identify a specific instance of the vanishing-or-exploding gradient problem. While two choices of spiking neural network mappings solve this problem at initialization, only the one with a constant slope of the neuron membrane potential at threshold guarantees the equivalence of the training trajectory between spiking and artificial neural networks with rectified linear units. For specific image classification architectures comprising feed-forward dense or convolutional layers, we demonstrate that deep spiking neural network models can be effectively trained from scratch on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, or fine-tuned on large-scale datasets, such as CIFAR10,~CIFAR100 and PLACES365, to achieve the exact same performance as that of artificial neural networks, surpassing previous spiking neural networks. Our approach accomplishes high-performance classification with less than 0.3 spikes per neuron, lending itself for an energy-efficient implementation. We also show that fine-tuning spiking neural networks with our robust gradient descent algorithm enables their optimization for hardware implementations with low latency and resilience to noise and quantization.","Zhang, Tao; Xiang, Shuiying; Liu, Wenzhuo; Han, Yanan; Guo, Xingxing; Hao, Yue",Frontiers in Neuroscience,10.3390/electronics12173565,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170580778&doi=10.3390%2Felectronics12173565&partnerID=40&md5=beecd9f2e651ee9ddb9cb975c3a8d73e,learnable encoding,Synaptic weights,Surrogate gradient,Hybrid ANN–SNN architecture,,"AC-dominant computation

Since the advent of Transformers, SNNs have struggled to compete with artificial networks on modern sequential tasks, as they inherit limitations from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with the added challenge of training with non-differentiable binary spiking activations. However, a recent renewed interest in efficient alternatives to Transformers has given rise to state-of-the-art recurrent architectures named state space models (SSMs). This work systematically investigates, for the first time, the intersection of state-of-the-art SSMs with SNNs for long-range sequence modelling. Results suggest that SSM-based SNNs can outperform the Transformer on all tasks of a well-established long-range sequence modelling benchmark. It is also shown that SSM-based SNNs can outperform current state-of-the-art SNNs with fewer parameters on sequential image classification. Finally, a novel feature mixing layer is introduced, improving SNN accuracy while challenging assumptions about the role of binary activations in SNNs. This work paves the way for deploying powerful SSM-based architectures, such as large language models, to neuromorphic hardware for energy-efficient long-range sequence modelling.","Yang, Yuchen; Liu, Jingcheng; Yu, Chengting; Yang, Chengyi; Wang, Gaoang; Wang, Aili",,10.1088/2634-4386/ade183,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009129892&doi=10.1088%2F2634-4386%2Fade183&partnerID=40&md5=b67fe63ab11494a23713296aaed1377a,learnable and adaptive encoding,"Synaptic weights

rayyan-378478161,P14,2023,Single {{Channel Speech Enhancement Using U-Net Spiking Neural Networks}},"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue for energy-efficient computations on neuromorphic hardware, leveraging the unique advantages of spike-based signaling. Despite their potential, SNNs often lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in performance, mainly due to the complexity of effectively translating ANN activation values into the time domain spikes. This challenge arises due to the quantization and unevenness errors that occur when mapping continuous activations to discrete spikes and irregular spike timing. This paper introduces NeuBridge, an innovative ANN-SNN conversion method that utilize adaptive temporal coding to significantly reduce the number of required time steps without compromising accuracy. NeuBridge addresses the errors by employing a decode-encode neuron and adaptive temporal coding, effectively bridging the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs. By establishing an equivalence between quantized ANNs and SNNs and optimizing the temporal coding process, we improve SNN performance with as few as 2 time steps. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that NeuBridge consistently performs better than existing conversion methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving high performance within just 3 time steps.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75\% on CIFAR-10 dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time processing possible.","Jin, Cheng; Zhu, Rui-Jie; Wu, Xiao; Deng, Liang-Jian",Biomimetics,10.48550/arXiv.2203.16117,,learnable encoding,Synaptic weights,Surrogate gradient,Hybrid ANN–SNN architecture,,,Faster training,,Vision,"Grayscale images

The methods used previously to generate spiking speech data are not capable of encoding speech in real-time or encoding very large modern speech datasets efficiently for input to neuromorphic processors. The ability to efficiently encode audio data to spikes will enable a wider variety of spiking audio datasets to be available and can also enable algorithmic development of real-time neuromorphic automatic speech recognition systems. Therefore, we developed speech2spikes, a simple and efficient audio processing pipeline that encodes recorded audio into spikes and is suitable for real-time operation with low-power neuromorphic processors. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method for audio to spike encoding we show that a small feed-forward spiking neural network trained on data generated with the pipeline achieves accuracy on the Google Speech Commands recognition task, exceeding the state-of-the art set by Spiking Speech Commands, a prior spiking encoding of the Google Speech Commands dataset, by over 10\%.

How to borrow high-level brain dynamic mechanisms to help neuromorphic computing achieve energy advantages is a fundamental issue. This work presents an application-oriented algorithm-software-hardware co-designed neuromorphic system for this issue. First, we design and fabricate an asynchronous chip called ``Speck'', a sensing-computing neuromorphic system on chip. With the low processor resting power of 0.42mW, Speck can satisfy the hardware requirements of dynamic computing: no-input consumes no energy. Second, we uncover the ``dynamic imbalance'' in spiking neural networks and develop an attention-based framework for achieving the algorithmic requirements of dynamic computing: varied inputs consume energy with large variance. Together, we demonstrate a neuromorphic system with real-time power as low as 0.70mW.

This model, the first of its kind, works by operating in a never-ending process of “guess-and-check”, where neurons predict the activity values of one another and then adjust their own activities to make better future predictions. The interactive, iterative nature of our system fits well into the continuous time formulation of sensory stream prediction and, as we show, the model’s structure yields a local synaptic update rule, which can be used to complement or as an alternative to online spike-timing dependent plasticity. In this article, we experiment with an instantiation of our model consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire units. However, the framework within which our system is situated can naturally incorporate more complex neurons such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our experimental results in pattern recognition demonstrate the potential of the model when binary spike trains are the primary paradigm for inter-neuron communication. Notably, spiking neural coding is competitive in terms of classification performance and experiences less forgetting when learning from a task sequence, offering a more computationally economical, biologically-motivated alternative to popular artificial neural networks.","Hens, Freek; Dehshibi, Mohammad Mahdi; Bagheriye, Leila; Shahsavari, Mahyar; Tajadura-Jiménez, Ana",,10.48550/arXiv.2407.08362,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08362,learnable and adaptive encoding,"Synaptic weights

Existing state-of-the-art methods train a spiking neural network (SNN) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve energy-efficient and fast inference speed in complex/unknown scenes. These methods typically assume that the environment is static while the obstacles in real-world scenes are often dynamic. The movement of obstacles increases the complexity of the environment and poses a great challenge to the existing methods. In this work, we approach robust dynamic obstacle avoidance twofold. First, we introduce the neuromorphic vision sensor (i.e., event camera) to provide motion cues complementary to the traditional Laser depth data for handling dynamic obstacles. Second, we develop an DRL-based event-enhanced multimodal spiking actor network (EEM-SAN) that extracts information from motion events data via unsupervised representation learning and fuses Laser and event camera data with learnable thresholding. Experiments demonstrate that our EEM-SAN outperforms state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance methods by a significant margin, especially for dynamic obstacle avoidance.","Wang, Shuai; Zhang, Dehao; Belatreche, Ammar; Xiao, Yichen; Qing, Hongyu; We, Wenjie; Zhang, Malu; Yang, Yang",,10.48550/arXiv.2407.05310,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05310,Adaptive encoding,Adaptive (data-driven) parameters,Surrogate gradient,Pure SNN architecture,"Sparse spike activity
